## **Q2**
## Removed jQuery
I've removed jQuery from the webpage and all related code. jQuery was initially used for DOM manipulation and event handling.

## **Q3**
My script indeed creates a welcome message and an exit button that are displayed when the webpage loads.

## **Q4**
## Form Addition
I've included a form on the website for user interaction. As this is a client-side assignment, the form currently doesn't have server-side functionality but could have been used for tasks such as user feedback submission or contact forms.
If I were to add server-side functionality to the form, it would involve submitting the form data to a server-side script for processing. Upon submission, the server-side script would handle the form data, which could include tasks such as storing the data in a database, sending emails, or performing other relevant actions based on the submitted information. For example, the server-side script could validate the form input, sanitize it to prevent any security vulnerabilities and then store the validated data in a database for further processing or analysis. Additionally, it could send a confirmation email to the user or perform any other necessary tasks related to the form submission
