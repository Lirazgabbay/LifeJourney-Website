      Hello! My name is Liraz Gabbay, and I'm excited to share a bit about myself with you. At 22 years old, I
      find myself immersed in the vibrant world of computer science, currently navigating my way through my
      second
      year of studies.

      I have a big sister who I love very much. She's older than me and has always been there for me.
      We're a
      close family, and I'm grateful for their support and love.

    <h2 id="Goals">Goals and Aspirations: </h2>
    <div>
      I have big dreams for my future. Right now, I'm focused on doing well in school and graduating with
      good
      grades. I want to be really good at computer science and maybe even get a cool job in the tech
      industry
      one
      day. Besides school, I also want to try new things and explore different opportunities. Maybe I'll
      start
      my
      own business someday or travel to new places. I'm open to whatever life throws my way!
